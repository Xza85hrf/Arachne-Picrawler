Assistants API tools

Beta

============================

Explore tools for file search, code, and function calling.

Assistants created using the Assistants API can be equipped with tools that allow them to perform more complex tasks or interact with your application. We provide built-in tools for assistants, but you can also define your own tools to extend their capabilities using Function Calling.

The Assistants API currently supports the following tools:

[

File Search

Built-in RAG tool to process and search through files
